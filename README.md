The Technology in our life website is a page for people addicted to technology, people who are getting away from personal relationships in favor of virtual ones.

Users can find information to learn more about Tech in our life: Introduction with a video by Jaron Lanier for TED, talking about technology in our lives, About us, with information about what we offer, sign up form and session times and our contacts. Our focus is to help people balance their digital and in-person lives.
