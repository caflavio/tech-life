# Technology in our life

The Technology in our life website is a page for people addicted to technology, people who are getting away from personal relationships in favor of virtual ones.
The idea was to create a simple and straightforward page that did not need a vast content, considering that the focus is to reduce the use of technology 

Users can find information to learn more about Tech in our life: Introduction with a video by Jaron Lanier for TED, talking about technology in our lives, About us, with information about what we offer, sign up form and session times and our contacts. Our focus is to help people balance their digital and in-person lives.

- __The intro page image__

    - The Intro page includes a photograph and superimposed text to allow the user to understand the purpose of the page.
    - On the side, a sentence from Jaron Lainer (http://www.jaronlanier.com/gadgetwebresources.html) is placed, to make the user reflect if he really needs help.
    - Below the sentence was added a video of Jaron Lainer speaking to TED Talk.
    - The idea of the content is to make an impact on the user and draw attention to the need to talk about it.

### Features Left to Implement

- Create a new page with videos of speeches.
- Have virtual sessions integrated into the page for users who still don't want to have direct contact with other people.
- Automate the scheduling process to send an invitation directly to the user with the location and date.

### Validator Testing 

- I have tested the webpage in different devices: iPhone 7/7Plus/12, Motorola: G8, Samsumng, browsers: Chrome, Firefox and Safari and share the link with family and friends.

  ### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.
